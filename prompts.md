## Prompt 1: Issue Resolution & Cleanup
```
Come up with a plan to resolve issue LC103 in our issue tracker @ISSUES.md. Move completed tasks to @00_completed_issues.md. Make sure to update these files when done using @markdown-issue-tracker. Review, read, and understand @docs/ and @README.md. When creating test make sure to use @zig-test-engineer. Clean up any temp files or test files that we don't need when done. ultrathink

## Prompt 2: Session Review & Issue Tracking
```
During this session, were any new issues found or potential improvements that we should add to our issue tracker and index files @ISSUES.md @00_index.md? If you did find issues, make sure to add helpful links when updating the issue tracker and use @markdown-issue-tracker. ultrathink
